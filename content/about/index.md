My name is Akhil, and I'm deeply interested in building useful things. I use the word "build" in a broad senseâ€” fom writing articles to creating software. I'm currerntly studying for my Salesforce Administrator exam, and am pursing a career building applications on the Salesforce ecosystem. In addition to learning Salesforce, I'm learning to write software. I'm familiar with C and Python languages, and I'm looking to advance my knowledge in web development. 

In my free time I pratice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
